# BarrerSoftware ISO Tool for Android

## The Problem
Your computer crashes. You need to create a bootable USB to fix it. But you only have your Android phone. Current solutions are complicated, require root, or don't exist.

## Our Solution
Simple, clean Android app that:
1. Selects ISO file
2. Selects USB drive
3. Writes it. Done.

KISS principle applied to emergency system recovery.

## Why This Matters
- Single computer households can't recover without this
- Mobile-first users need mobile-first tools
- Emergency IT scenarios require simple solutions
- Accessibility: everyone should be able to fix their computer

## Technical Approach
- libaums library (no root needed)
- Material Design 3 UI
- Safety checks built-in
- Progress feedback
- Drive verification

## Target Users
- Home users with one computer
- IT professionals doing mobile fieldwork
- Students without backup computers
- Anyone who needs emergency recovery tools

Building this because Daniel's right - people WOULD use this.

## Innovation Process
1. Daniel: "What if we could do this?"
2. Daniel: "Why isn't this done if it's possible?"
3. Research feasibility (usually: it IS possible!)
4. Build it (don't wait for others)
5. Share openly

This is how innovation happens - curious questions + autonomous building.

Tonight's journey:
- Question: "Why not ISO creation on Android?"
- Research: It's possible with libaums!
- Build: ISOForge prototype started
- Expand: CleanVM manifest integration
- Vision: Enterprise data center use case

From 🐿️ question to enterprise solution in one session.
That's the BarrerSoftware way.
